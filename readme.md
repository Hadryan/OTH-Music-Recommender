## Current Progress

####9.7.20

* Progress:
    * first version of recommender working, not taking genre and artists into account yet
    * started testing with the mpd api, in order to get the song data I currently still parse directly from the files metadata
* next steps: 
    * upgrading the recommender so it takes genre and artists into account
    * implementing method that parses the metadata via mpd
